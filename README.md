# Portfolio

## Description

This is my personal portfolio webpage. On the sidebar there are links to my social media, my resume (coming soon), and my contact information. The main section is comprised of the About Me section, the Project Listing section (which consists of buttons with which users can nagivate to specific projects below), and the actual projects/ upcoming projects, which include project titles, screenshots of the deployed webpages, and project descriptions. There is also a side button for users to get back to the top of the webpage without scrolling all the way back up. At the very bottom of the main section I've included a link to my GitHub profile for users who'd like to check out more of my current and future projects. This webpage is mobile-friendly and tablet friendly, with the help of media queries I set up in the css file. 

The URL of the deployed portfolio webpage is: 
https://feddericowayne.github.io/Portfolio/

Here's a screenshot of the webpage:
