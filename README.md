# Challenge 1: Code Refactoring

## Description

I was given a starter code and stylesheet of a webpage to refactor so that both the html and the css look cleaner and more accessible.
I did this by changing some non-semantic tags into semantic tags in html, adding alt attributes to images, and combining some selectors in css. 
I also made the page more mobile-friendly by refactoring the display properties and by utilizing media queries.
Lastly, I put in a drop-down menu with JavaScript for mobile users so they can click on an icon to view the three links.

The URL of the deployed, refactored webpage is can be found at: https://feddericowayne.github.io/Challenge-1-Refactoring/

Here's a screenshot of the webpage:
